                            <p>The <strong>Conventional</strong> <strong>Classroom Program</strong> is designed to help students in getting conceptual clarity on certain topics. This program is re-created to cater the requirements of the students by providing a unique set of question in class and supplementing the same with a self-practice set booklet. Questions are handpicked which would compel the students to ponder on each &amp; every minute aspect of the subject and also make them well verse with interlinking of concepts and subjects. Sincere attempts have been made to simplify and infuse the thought pattern required to solve the questions in a given time manner.&nbsp;By regular practice of the given questions, feeling of writing actual exam will be replicated.&nbsp;While solving the questions, the students can clear their doubts in the class itself. The questions included in the booklet are meant for self-practice at home. Once all the questions are successfully solved by the students, a subject-wise test is there to test their regular preparation.</p>

                            <p className='py-3'>Students who have registered for the Conventional Question&nbsp;Practice Program can choose the package which suits best for the candidate. They are&nbsp;available in both the modes i.e. Online and Offline.&nbsp;The students will learn about new topics along while&nbsp;revising the topics that have been already covered by them during ESE Prelims preparation. In each test, questions are asked based on certain important topics, and after one or two tests the topics that have already been covered, will be repeated.&nbsp;This helps students in revising the topics while moving forward with the preparation of all the subjects.</p>

                            <p>Along with these two programs, by taking CQPP,&nbsp;the students can also benefit with the test and counselling sessions that help students in writing answers as per the standards set by the UPSC. The question selection ability of students also gets improved by taking the CQPP. To cap it all, on completion of CQPP, the students become experts in accuracy and time management skills that are very important in cracking the ESE Mains exam.</p>
